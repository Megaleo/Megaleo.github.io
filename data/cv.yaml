    # - name: Organization of seminar series on "topological quantum" physics
    #   start_date: 2024-01
    #   end_date: present
    #   summary: Alongside Amir-Reza Negari and other fellow graduate students, I organized
    #     an informal seminar series geared towards the graduate students and postdocs
    #     at the Perimeter Institute about anything related to topological and quantum
    #     physics.
    #   highlights:
    #   - The main purpose was to have a space for easier discussion of topics, which
    #     would not fit in or take more time to present as an "official" seminar.
    #   - It had 29 presentations in its first year on a wide range of topics, including
    #     from external visitors.
