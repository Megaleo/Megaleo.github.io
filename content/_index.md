PhD student in theoretical physics at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/) and [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

I employ quantum information theory to study many-body quantum systems, focusing on relations between **entanglement**, **symmetries** and **mixed states**.
