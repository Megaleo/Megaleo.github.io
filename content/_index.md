PhD student in theoretical physics at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/) and [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

I employ quantum information theory to study many-body quantum systems, focusing on relations between **entanglement**, **symmetries** and **mixed states**. For more details, see [Research](/research).

I am also part of the [QFormal initiative](https://qform.al/). We formalize quantum information theory in the computer using [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).
